# AI-Based Water Body Detection and Environmental Monitoring Using Satellite Imagery

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available from:

- Dataset Name: Satellite Images of Water Bodies(Images and Masks of Satellite Images of Water Bodies for Image Segmentation)
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/franciscoescobar/satellite-images-of-water-bodies

This dataset contains satellite images used for training and testing the water body detection model.


# 📌 Project Overview

This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning techniques to automatically detect water bodies such as lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and ponds from satellite images. The system helps in environmental monitoring, disaster management, agricultural planning, and smart city development.

The model analyzes satellite imagery and classifies water and non-water regions to generate accurate detection results.

# 🎯 Objectives

To detect water bodies from satellite images using deep learning.

To improve accuracy using image preprocessing techniques.

To build a scalable and reusable AI pipeline.

To support environmental monitoring and decision-making.

# 📊 Applications

Flood detection and disaster management

Agricultural water resource monitoring

Climate change analysis

Smart city planning

Government environmental monitoring systems
